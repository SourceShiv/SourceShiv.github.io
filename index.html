                        <p>Hey there! I'm Shiv. I was born and raised in the city of London. I eventually made my way to the towns of Warwickshire and Leamington Spa. That's where I dove into the world of mechanical engineering at the University of Warwick, spending four years (bachelors and masters) immersed in the fascinating world of problem-solving and innovation.</p>
                        <p>
                            My roots are grounded in Hindu and Indian traditions, which have shaped my values and outlook on life. One thing I've learned from these traditions is that we're all capable of achieving incredible things. I truly believe that with hard work, discipline and dedication, there's nothing we can't accomplish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Engineering is more than just a field for me; it's the ability to shape a world. I thrive on tackling complex problems and finding creative solutions. Whether it's designing a new mechanism or figuring out an 'impossible' puzzle, I'm all in. Solving problems is in my nature. Creativity is my playground, and I love turning abstract ideas into tangible solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my downtime, you'll find me indulging in a mix of interests including trading, chess, travelling, fitness (from hitting the gym to practicing MMA), and diving into discussions about ethics and philosophy. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Professionally, I'm open to various job roles, but my passion lies in problem-solving, mathematical, and modelling positions. I'm eager to dive into roles that challenge me and make use of my analytical skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I find inspiration in Stoicism and try to weave its principles into my daily life. One quote from Marcus Aurelius always resonates with me is:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <cite>"We have power over our minds, not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength." - Marcus Aurelius</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            It's a reminder that while we can't control everything, we can always control how we respond.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thanks for stopping by and learning a bit about me. If you're as passionate about problem-solving, creativity, and bringing purpose to the world, let's connect!
